# SearchexplorerMa

I made this website for customers to optimize search engine so that customer can directly become users to the site. My project stands out because if a developer was to make to make changes on this code it would be easily accessible due to the class and alt ids. This assignment I learned how to make semantic htlml elements as well as making alt attributes. Finally as this was my first assignment I learned how to navigate git a lot better.
